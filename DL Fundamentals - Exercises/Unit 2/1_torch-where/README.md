## Exercise 1: Introducing More PyTorch Functions To Make Your Code More Efficient



The goal of this exercise is to simplify the code implementation
of the `Perceptron` class. For this, we are going to use the `torch.where` function for the `forward` method.

Your task is to learn about `torch.where` [using the PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/). Finding `torch.where` in the API documentation is part of this exercise :).

Then, using `torch.where`, make the appropriate changes in the `forward` method as instructed in the notebook below.
